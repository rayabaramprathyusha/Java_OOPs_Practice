OOP Concepts Learned
1. Classes and Objects

Definition: Blueprint for creating objects; objects are instances of classes.

Key Idea: Encapsulate data (fields) and behavior (methods) in one unit.

2. Constructor and this Keyword

Constructor: Special method to initialize objects when created.

this: Refers to the current object, used to distinguish instance variables from parameters.

3. Inheritance

Definition: Mechanism where a class (child) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent).

Types:

Single Inheritance

Multi-level Inheritance

Hierarchical Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance using Interfaces

4. Polymorphism

Compile-time (Method Overloading): Same method name, different parameters.

Run-time (Method Overriding): Subclass provides a specific implementation of a parent method.

5. Abstraction

Definition: Hiding implementation details; showing only functionality.

Implemented via:

Abstract classes (can have both abstract and concrete methods)

Interfaces (only method signatures, multiple inheritance supported)

6. Encapsulation

Definition: Wrapping data (fields) and methods together, controlling access via access modifiers.

Example: Private fields with public getters/setters.

7. Composition vs Aggregation

Composition: Strong ownership, partâ€™s lifecycle tied to owner.

Aggregation: Weak ownership, part can exist independently.
